# dream-menu

This is a project to mainly practice my CSS skills. I am looking to practice some basic css by constructing my own menu of a fantasy bakery that I would open if I were to be a baker.

I think I am pretty confident on my CSS skills. I didn't really have much trouble although I still had to search up syntax. I would like to be able to just do this code from memory, but I am pretty confident where I am right now.
