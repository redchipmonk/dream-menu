# dream-menu

This is a project to mainly practice my css skills. I was recently introduced to CSS through freecodecamp.org. This project is heavily inspired by the coffee menu of the responsive web design course. I am looking to practice some basic css by constructing my own menu of a fantasy bakery that I would open if I were to be a baker.
